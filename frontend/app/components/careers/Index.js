      **What is Products Optimization?**
      
      A Products Optimization job involves improving the visibility and ranking of products listed on platforms like Amazon and eBay. The goal is to enhance product performance using real data, which leads to better traffic, higher sales, and increased profitability for merchants.
      
      **How it Works:**
      
      This job is powered by AI, but requires crucial human involvement for authenticity and effectiveness. You don't need to be an SEO expert - anyone with a mobile phone and internet connection can participate. All backend optimization techniques are managed by AI—your job is to contribute your presence and human verification to make the process real and trustworthy.
      
      **Why Human Involvement is Important:**
      
      AI can automate many tasks, but platforms like Amazon and eBay require genuine human signals to ensure the process is not manipulated by bots. Human interaction provides:
      
      • Real engagement and behavior patterns
      • Trust signals for product authenticity  
      • Verification that AI cannot fake
      
      **What You'll Do:**
      
      You are not giving reviews or making false claims. You are simply assisting our AI system in understanding how real users interact with certain product listings—such as clicking, searching, and spending time on them. This helps train the algorithm to improve product positioning on platforms.
      
      **About Axon:**
      
      Our platform, Axon, partners with trusted merchants to manage and optimize their products. As a Products Optimizer, you'll help them improve sales and visibility, and earn a daily salary plus commission.
